# Iris Flower Classification Project

This repository contains the code and resources for the Iris Flower Classification project using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and its kernels. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) based on their sepal and petal characteristics.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing the Iris dataset (`iris.csv`).
- `src/`: Directory containing the Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
  - `data_preprocessing.py`: Script for exploring and preprocessing the dataset.
  - `svm_classification.py`: Script for training SVM models using different kernels.
  - `evaluation.py`: Script for evaluating model performance and generating evaluation metrics.
  - `visualization.py`: Script for visualizing decision boundaries, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.
- `results/`: Directory containing evaluation results and visualization outputs.
  

## Results

- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) for SVM models trained with different kernels.
- Confusion matrices and ROC curves for model evaluation and visualization.

## Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance further.
- Experimentation with additional feature engineering techniques.
- Deployment of the trained model for real-world predictions.
